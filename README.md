# Test task - Delivery Food

Food delivery serves as an evaluative assignment that was assigned to me by Alsodev during the course of my application for the senior front-end position.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the Delivery Food up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ru) - JavaScript runtime environment  
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Package managers for installing dependencies

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/M34R7/delivery-food.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd delivery-food
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Application
